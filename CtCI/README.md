## 1. Arrays and Strings
1.1 Is Unique
 - Assuming all characters are within ASCII (i.e. 128 characters), define an array of boolean with a length of 128. Use this to check if a characeter is already used within the string. (index with characters) (O(min(c,n)), O(1)) where c is the number of characters in the character set.
 - Bit vector solution?
 - Sort (nlogn) and compare consecutive elements
 - Compare each character with every other character of the string (O(n2), O(1))
